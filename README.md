# Selenium WedDriver Automation Project

This is a pet project to polish up my test automation skills 
using Python and Selenium WebDriver. As an object for automation 
I chose a demo online store: https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/.

**NOTE:** Since I'm new in test automation and Python, comments and advice are very welcome.
Please be polite.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
1. Programming language - `Python`
2. Testing framework - `Pytest`
3. Automation framework - `Selenium WebDriver`

## üöÄ How to run the tests
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies from [the "requirements.txt" file](https://github.com/yuliyashibaeva/python-selenium-online-store/blob/main/requirements.txt).
3. Run the test in the console, for example, with the command:<br>
```shell
pytest -v .\tests\
```

## ‚úçÔ∏è Command line options
1. The tests can be run in Chrome or Firefox. Write a command with option 
`--browser=chrome` or `--browser=firefox` to choose a browser. 
The default browser is Chrome.
2. The tests can be run in a headless mode. Write a command with option 
`--headless`. The default value is `False`.

## üìù Test Cases
### Account creation tests from [the "test_account_creation.py" file](https://github.com/yuliyashibaeva/python-selenium-online-store/blob/main/tests/test_account_creation.py):
### New user account should be created
1. Open the page https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/customer/account/create/.
2. Fill in all the required fields.
3. Click the "Create an Account" button.<br>

**Expected result:** The success message should be present on the page 
and the user data should be the same as entered in the 2nd step.

### Account creation without a required field should case validation
This test is parametrized. The parameter is one of the field: First Name, Last Name, Email, Password, Confirm Password.
1. Open the page https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/customer/account/create/.
2. Fill in all the required fields except *<skipped_field>*.
3. Click the "Create an Account" button.<br>

**Expected result:** The skipped field should be marked with red frame 
and have the error message under it.

### Account creation with the existing user email should cause an error
1. Create a new user.
2. Open the page https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/customer/account/create/.
3. Fill in all the required fields with the same values as in the 1st step.
4. Click the "Create an Account" button.<br>

**Expected result:** There should be an error message saying 
that a user with the same email already exists.
